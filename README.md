# Surfs_Up

Overview of the statistical analysis:

  While I was in Hawai last year I found that I enjoyed surfing a majority of the time. I am looking for a way to move here and do business in this field. I found that Surf n’ Shake shops that sell ice cream and surf boards do pretty good in the area. Due to my financial standing I am looking for an investor, my best candidate I feel can be WAV, he is very famous for surfing. Having him be a partner can also increase sales and popularity of my business. He did invest before in a shop and it went out of buisness. I will take the data from previous years to infer how risky will this be.  

Results:

   Based on my analysis I can say there really isn’t a huge difference between the two months, June and December. From  my personal experience I have lived in Jersey City, California, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Majority of the time 56 degrees to 85 is actually very nice weather. What I can infer from the data is that it has been very beautiful in Oaho. Many cities when its under 50 degrees, its not very pleasent to be out and many cities when its over 90, due to humidity its too hot to be out. 

   Also based on this data we have extracted 1700 temps of June and 1517 of December, this can also cause a discrepency about the weathers. To get a better understanding of the year around we should extract data from quarterly months to understand a better view.

   Another difference from the data we have extracted, we have been looking at the temperatures, we should also be looking at the type of conditions or that temperature.
